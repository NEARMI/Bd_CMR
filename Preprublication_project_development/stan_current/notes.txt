Notes from fitting populations in different ways
------------------------------------------------


[1] Positive relationships between Bd and survival

 -- Some populations are estimated to have a positive relationship between Bd and survival.
  -- This effect is strongly correlated with smaller sampled sizes
  -- These results are generally robust to how fitting occurs (pop alone, pop with only other pops of the same species, many species and pops at once)

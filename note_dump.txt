##### Older notes from the fits run the week of March 31 ----

## 1) The model run with all of the individuals from all populations apart from NOVI ran with no divergent transitions.
 ## A) though 400 warmup and 600 samples will be far too little for the full model. Probably something like 500 warmup and 2500
  ##   samples could be enough
 ## B) Even with all of the individuals, the fixed effect coefficient estimates are still pretty garbage
    ##   ^^ Most overlapping zero with wide CI
    ##   ^^ RANA having a super strong length effect ** Need to add sex?
 ## C) The model has changed a lot so need to work back through all of the priors to make sure they are still sensible 

##### Some older notes that are still relevant ----

#### ---- Multi-pop model
 ## A) Because of difficulty with the overlap of species and location I am collapsing
  ##   all of the Rana species, as this will allow for a fixed effect of species and a random effect of location 
 ## B) One species doesn't have any MeHg and the location isn't shared. Will have to try and use a fixed effect + pop_spec random effect?
  ##   The hope here would be to use an intercept and a species and random location so at least the intercept can inform

#### ---- Some things I learned from playing with the multi-pop model:
  ## --- A) The small populations can teach us basically nothing. Because of this using single intercepts for "species" is likely
  ##        going to be pretty dangerous. The strategy is likely going to have to be to have species as a random effect -- but then we
  ##        are back to the original problem of how to specify these random effects (as location and species are super correlated)
  ## --- B) ^^ Continuing this thought, having something like one effect of "size" gets washed out across populations when so many populations
  ##        cant help resolve this relationship. Will want to have population-unique deviates for basically all covariates

#### ---- Single-pop model

 ## A) Estimating the effect of Bd on survival is hard... Most estimates overlap 0

 ## B) Collapsing subsites to site and using a day-level detection random effect and periods of population closure
  ##   seems to be the most viable strategy moving forward (See C and D below)

 ## C) It seems like estimating survival in very narrow time windows just isn't feasible
  ##   ^^ Which means using periods of open vs closed populations is likely the way forward
  ##   ^^ But what then is the threshold with so many different sampling schemes?

 ## D) Adding individual and day random effects for detection costs little
  ##    (though individual random effect for within-season survival is unidentifiable)
  ##   Mixing still fast, estimates very similar to them not included except for detection which improves

 ## E) With three processes (between season survival, within season survival, and detection) it is still an open
  ##   question of what covariates to include in which processes

 ## F) I have indexing columns that modification of the model structure is now easy. There is probably less need
  ##   to have so many .stan files in stan_current
